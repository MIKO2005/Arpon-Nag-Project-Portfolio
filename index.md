# Smile Recognition Using OpenCV and scikit-learn
Smile detection is a subfield of facial expression analysis with applications ranging from photo selection to user experience analysis, smiling payment, and patient monitoring. Conventional techniques frequently use a powerful binary classifier to extract low-level facial characteristics and identify smiles.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was training my machine learning model for the project. It took various steps to reach that stage. Such as, I had to start with loading the datasets, then producing the smile training data. Eventually, this led to training my model to recognize smiling faces. To do this, the previous steps were very important. Before completing the first milestone, the issues I ran into were mainly not being that well acquainted with the libraries that I have been working with and some problems regarding debugging the codes. To overcome the problems, at first, I concentrated on learning a bit more about the libraries I have been using. Other than that, to debug the code, I tried to traceback to the error and understand why it’s happening, and then if it still doesn’t get fixed, I tried googling to find the solution, and my last resort was reaching out to my instructor for help.
